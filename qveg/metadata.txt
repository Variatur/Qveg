description=This plugin loads Queensland vegetation management data from the Queensland government feature server. Layers can be loaded using property (lot-plan), regional ecosystem, or extent searches. The plugin can also load imagery, basemaps, various informative overlays, and export maps to a georeferenced PDF. A number of vector layers include styling which allows QGIS Actions to generate formatted Google Earth KML files and interogate Queensland government online databases to collect information on Accepted Development Vegetation Clearing Code (ADVCC) and Area Management Plan (AMP) notification history.
